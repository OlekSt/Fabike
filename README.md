### SURFACE 

Design choices:
* General guidelines are taken from the existing website www.fabike.it, and approved by the main designed of the company, Fabio Putzolu. 
* The overall structure of existing pages(www.fabik.it) will be re-created in this project, but will be coded from scratch, and all the non-existing pages/features will be added during the development of the project.

Colors:
* All the colors & color combination will be derived from the 4 main colors used for the frames/bikes: black, blue, yellow, & red.

For the purpose of the project the following colors (matching or related) will be used:

**Greys-Blacks**

Images:
* All product(bikes, frames) & lifestyle photos were taken by the designer of the frames, Fabio Putzolu.

### Learning point: 

> Data model for Products done at the beginning of the project didn't take into account some aspects of data manipulation, specifically creating a unique product record with a combination of model, color, size, components, etc. Based on the knowledge & experience I have obtained during the project's implementation, I'd plan a Product data model differently, i.e. each individual combination of a model, color, size, components would be given an individual sku code. This would simplify quite a number of processes within the following apps: cart, checkout.

##### Hosting media files with AWS
The static files and media files (product images) are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with public access. 

##### Sending email with Gmail
To be able to send emails with Gmail, you need to connect it to your Gmail account, setting up your email address in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your app password generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.



### Local Deployment
To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:
- An IDE, e.g., [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/), or any other 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)    

Besides, you need to have/create accounts at:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to setup the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

Follow these steps:
1. Copy the repository by entering this in your IDE:
- git clone https://github.com/OlekSt/Fabike
2. Create .env file and add it to .gitignore to protect your sensitive variables
- env. file example:
```
import os  
os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"    
```

**In IDE**:

3. Install all the requirements: 
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. Start the server:
- python3 manage.py runserver
5. Migrate the models for the DB
- python3 manage.py makemigrations
- python3 manage.py migrate
6. Load data using fixtures:
- python3 manage.py loaddata products
- python3 manage.py loaddata events
7. Create a superuser for admin 
- python3 manage.py createsuperuser
8. Start the server:
- python3 manage.py runserver

Now the project should be active on localhost port 8000. 
To access admin you need to add `/admin` at the end of the url.
